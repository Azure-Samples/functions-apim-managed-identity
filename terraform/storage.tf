/*
These are the storage accounts used to store the Function App code.
Because we are using a managed identity to connect to the storage (see the `storage_uses_managed_identity` property on the function app), we also provide a role assignment to the identity.
More details on the role can be found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference?tabs=blob#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity-preview
